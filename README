initramfs directory used when compiling new kernels


Initfamfs directory - initially generated using voodoo injector.

Files were initially created using the voodoo_injector initramfs generation script. 
I've been modifying the init.rc file directly and storing newly compiled kernel modules here. 
Compiling a new kernel will use the initramfs directory from this location.
